figure out how to save data to array

everytime you click on a square:
	1. add token to dom
	2. add to board array
	3. check win combinations against board array
		if won, lost, tie?
		if won, lost, tie? delete game
	4. change turn

click save should persist

click save when already persisted should update
 (check if board exists? if so patch...)
