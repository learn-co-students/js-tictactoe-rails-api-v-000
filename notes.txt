Things I've done:

1) Create an empty currentGame() method in tictactoe.js,
just to pass a jasmine test

2. Thought about creating a new script tag in the index.html
to house listeners for the buttons, but then realized I could
do the same thing in tictactoe.js

3. Created a seperated 'attachListeners' function, specifically
for the buttons and add a call of attachListeners() to the document.ready. The buttons have ids, so I was able to use
getElementById instead of getElementsByTagName.
