// Explanation of presentPreviousGames function:
// Use jQuery .get() method to send an AJAX request of HTTP type GET to "/games"
// "/games" is the string URL where we would normally retrieve the index page of all games
// $.get() method returns a jqXHR object, on which we call done(),
// passing in the callback function that handles the response.
// In games#index, we store the AR::Relation of all game instances in the games variable
// games = Game.all and then we call render json: games
// This tells the requestor that the response is plain text JSON string
// (of the JSON object representing all the game instances stored in the DB)
// so we can use JS to operate on it.
// The response JSON object has a top-level key "data" that points to the top-level data object
// which is like an array of all AR game instances, in this case
// object.key = value
// Calling response.data.length will tell us how many games were saved in the DB and rendered to JSON
// Clicking the button#previous element when NO previously-saved games exist in the database
// does NOT add any children to the div#games element in the DOM
// Clicking the button#previous element when previously-saved games DO exist in the DB
// adds those previous games as buttons in the DOM's div#games element,
// as long as buttons for those games have NOT already been added to div#games element.
// There will NOT be duplicate buttons for a game in the div#games element

// b/c the button has a data-id property = the id attribute value of the game instance to restore

// "/games/:id" is the string URL that we would normally use to get to the game show page

// document.querySelectorAll('td') returns a NodeList representing a list of the document's <td> elements,
// i.e., a list of the game board's square spaces (the current state)
// Using a for loop, we then set the current state of the game board to
